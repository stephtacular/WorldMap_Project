  ## About the Project
This project, completed for a WGU course, involves creating an interactive world map feature for a state government website. It utilizes SVG for the map interface, incorporates data from the World Bank API, and demonstrates expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Angular frameworks to build dynamic and responsive web applications.
  

  ### Built With
  - Angular
  - JavaScript
  - TypeScript

## Course Information
JavaScript Programming introduces students to programming with JavaScript, including how to use JavaScript to enhance a website. This course covers how to use existing frameworks, assets, and web content to enhance website functionality, as well as how to use application programming interfaces (APIs) and web services to add data capabilities to web applications.

## Competencies

<b>Writes Basic Scripts</b></br>
The learner writes basic scripts to accomplish tasks with JavaScript.

<b>Uses Existing Frameworks</b></br>
The learner uses existing frameworks, assets, and web content that address stakeholder preferences and enhance website functionality.

<b>Adds APIs and Web Services</b></br>
The learner adds data capabilities to web applications with application programming interfaces (APIs) and web services.

## Scenario
You are a developer for a state government office. On a previous project, your supervisor asked you to build a website with several pages related to a geographic area in the United States. Now your supervisor wants you to expand on this site and provide a website that provides information on each country in the world.

Your task is to present a map of the world in an SVG format so that each country is highlighted upon a mouse event. Then you will convert the SVG map into an interactive Angular component and connect the application to an API service to provide the country information.

## Requirements
- Use GitLab for project management.
- Integrate an SVG world map as an interactive component.
- Retrieve country data (name, capital, region, income level, etc.) using the World Bank API.
- Configure Angular routing to redirect the root URL.
- Design a two-column layout: one for the map and one for country details.
- Implement event binding to make the SVG map interactive.
- Build an API service with methods to fetch and display additional country information based on user interaction.
